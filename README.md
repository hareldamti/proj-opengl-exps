# OpenGL Experiments

This repo consists of a few OpenGL mini-projects along the way to harness the power of the GPU for graphics, physics simulations and machine learning.

To start a project, run the executable inside the folder.
To edit using Visual Studio Code:
  1. Install Visual Studio Build Tools.
  2. Run the cmd editor.bat and open code in it.

## Project 1 - 6 (Fragment Shader):
Using the independent parallel computation for each pixel to render a scene.
Uses:
  * Mandelbrot Set
  * Ray tracing
  * Mandelbulb
  * Geometric manipulations in 3D
  * Chladni Figures
